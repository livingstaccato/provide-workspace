# Git Workflow

📝 Detailed guide coming soon.

## Key Points

- Each package has its own git repository
- Changes are **auto-committed** but NOT auto-pushed
- Standard git workflows (branches, PRs) work normally

## Basic Workflow

```bash
cd pyvider/
# ... make changes (auto-committed) ...
git push

# Create PR on GitHub
gh pr create
```
